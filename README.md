Minimal symbol and syntax matching for Fortran in Sublime Text

Pull requests are welcome :)

I am no longer maintaining this syntax highlighting package, it has been superseded by my new package:

https://github.com/315234/SublimeFortran

Please switch to that one if you are running at least build 3084 of Sublime Text.
